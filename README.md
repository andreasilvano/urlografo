# URLOGRAFO<br><br>

is a "communicative machine" that creates interaction between individuals by connecting them through the act of listening. Users are invited to take action in pairs, each individual assigned to a specific role: listener or screamer. The person who screams tries to express his/her inner conscience through a scream, that is then picked up by the machine and converted into a graphic language. This process can only start when the listener activates the machine. The graphic depiction of what has been shouted is printed onto a receipt, the listener is invited to write down what he/she inferred from what he/she has just listened. The machine's goal is to highlight the necessity of a relationship between individuals in which the each person is prone to comprehend through his/her humanity the other person. Urlografo is not just any machine of acoustic analysis and audio wave plotting, but it becomes the mean by which human relationships originate and can continue to live on once the experience ends.
